# Embedded Project
 
This project is aimed at making our bedrooms a place to relax. Using this embedded systems project you no longer need to worry about checking on things around the house, just do it from bed. You now have the option to adjust your TV viewing angle, look out your front door, check if your lights are off in the house, and know if you have any doors or windows left open.
